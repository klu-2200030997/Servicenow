## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Transit Management System** is a custom-built solution on the **ServiceNow Platform** to streamline and automate bus service operations.  
It enables:
- Passengers to book and manage tickets, give feedback, and make payments  
- Drivers to access schedules and assignments  
- Administrators to oversee buses, routes, and generate reports  

The project leverages ServiceNow’s **tables, flows, business rules, notifications, dashboards, and catalog items** to deliver a smooth end-to-end transit experience.  
All configurations are packaged into an **Update Set** (`update_set.xml`) for easy import.
